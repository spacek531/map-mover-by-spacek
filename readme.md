# map mover by spacek

Map mover allows one to translate their map in X and Y directions. Rotation is not supported currently.

There are limitations to this plugin. Entity positions are not updated, and encoded position data for ride entrances, park entrances, stations, and shops are not updated. These must be removed before use.
